1980	international human rights groups have reported about them since the late 1980s. 
1950	an extensive system of political prison camps has been in continuous existence since the late 1950s and continues to operate up to the present time.
1960	Political Prison Camp No.14 covers 150 square kilometres of a mountainous area near Kaechon City in South Pyongan Province. It appears to have been in existence since the 1960s and was transferred to its present location in the early 1980s.

1970	First-hand witness testimony indicates that the camp has existed since the 1970s, although it was much smaller at that time. 
1996	Mr Kim Joo-il, a former KPA officer, explained how the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il personally visited his battalion in 1996. When Kim Jong-il noticed that the soldiers were not provided with food, he immediately divested the head of the battalion of his rank and had him sent, without trial, to a KPA prison camp.
1960	From the 1960s until its closure in mid-2012, the SSD operated Political Prison Camp No. 22 near Hoeryong (North Hamgyong Province). 
1980	Political Prison Camp No. 11, controlled by the State Security Department, was located on the upper slope of the Kwanmo mountain in North Hamgyong province. Initially, it was mainly used to detain high-profile prisoners and their families. At the end of the 1980s, this camp appears to have been closed since a villa for Kim Il-Sung was supposed to have been constructed in the area. The surviving prisoners were distributed between Camps 16 and 22.
1990	Political Prison Camps No. 12 and 13 (also run by the State Security Department) were in what is today Onsong County, North Hamgyong Province.  Inmates included families of former landowners, supporters of rival socialist factions and collaborators with the Japanese colonial administration. The camps were closed in the early 1990s. The surviving prisoners were apparently transferred to Camp No. 22.
1960	Since at least the early 1960s, a political prison existed in Sungho, near Pyongyang, which is sometimes referred to as Camp No. 26. It was closed in the early 1990s after a former political prisoner had disclosed its existence, and Amnesty International reported extensively on the camp.

1990	Located near Camp No. 14 on the south bank of the Taedong River, Camp No. 18 in Bukchang County (South Pyongan Province) may have held as many as 50,000 prisoners in the late 1990s.
1980	Political Prison Camp No. 17 was located in Toksong (South Hamgyong Province) and controlled by the Social Safety Agency, the predecessor organization of the Ministry of People’s Security. The camp was initially closed in the mid-1980s. Some witness testimony indicates that the camp was temporarily reopened in the late 1990s since Political Prison Camp No. 18 was unable to handle the large inflow of new detainees arrested in connection with the shimhwajo operation.

Some witness testimony indicates that the camp was temporarily reopened in the late 1990s since Political Prison Camp No. 18 was unable to handle the large inflow of new detainees arrested in connection with the shimhwajo operation.
1990	The Social Safety Agency reportedly also operated Camp No. 19 in Tanchon, South Hamgyong Province. The camp was closed around 1990 and most prisoners were released.
1987	Camp No. 23 in Toksong Country, South Hamgyong Province, also operated by the Social Safety Agency, was transformed into an ordinary prison in 1987. 
1982	The earliest estimate, provided in 1982 by the National Intelligence Service of the Republic of Korea, refers to a prison population of 105,000 prisoners.
1990	Later estimates, which were provided by non-governmental organizations, based on satellite images and testimony from guards and prisoners who were in the camps in the 1990s or early 2000s, range from 150,000-200,000 inmates.
2000	Later estimates, which were provided by non-governmental organizations, based on satellite images and testimony from guards and prisoners who were in the camps in the 1990s or early 2000s, range from 150,000-200,000 inmates.
1950	The DPRK began to establish its system of secret political prison camps in the late 1950s, as large purges were carried out under Kim Il-sung.
1970	 A large number of additional victims, including senior officials, were purged between the 1970s and 1990s to preclude any opposition within the Workers’ Party of Korea and the state apparatus to the dynastic succession of Kim Jong-il following the death of his father Kim Il-sung.

1981	In 1981, the witness’s entire family, including two children aged 2 and 4, was arrested by agents of the State Security Department and sent to Political Prison Camp No. 12. The witness, who thinks she was spared imprisonment because she had married into another family, never saw her family again. The family apparently became victim to the purges of side arms of Kim Il-sung’s family that were conducted to prevent challenges to the succession of Kim Jong-il. The family were relatives of Kim Hwan-hyup, who was related by marriage to Kim Jong-il. Despite being a high-ranking official of the Korean Worker’s Party, Kim Hwan-hyup was reportedly himself purged. 
1997	In 1997, the Ministry of People’s Security launched a comprehensive investigation, known as shimhwajo to identify officials who had concealed politically sensitive aspects of their family history. The operation was also strategically used to purge “old-guard” officials whose loyalty to Kim Jong-il was considered questionable. An estimated 20,000 suspects disappeared without trial in Political Prison Camp No. 18, although many were later released. In a subsequent counter-purge, thousands of MPS officials were arrested by the KPA Military Security Command and the SSD. In prison, they were often subjected to particularly harsh treatment and many died in detention. One former official relayed statistics kept by the MPS Corrections Bureau according to which only few of the MPS officials imprisoned during the counter-purge survived their prison stint. Mr Kim Gwang-il testified that guards at Kyohwaso No. 12 apparently received orders to single out particular prisoners for food ration cuts and other harsh punishments designed to kill them. He named two prisoners who had ended up in a kyohwaso on political charges and were killed in that manner. One of them was detained in reaction to the shimhwajo operation.
1981	Mr Shin Dong-hyuk was born in Political Prison Camp No. 14 in 1981, as a result of a relationship the guards had arranged between his parents, who had no choice in the matter. His father and his family had apparently been imprisoned in the camp, because one of Mr Shin’s uncles had fled to the Republic of Korea.
1975	In 1975, the entire family of the witness were arrested by the State Security Department, without being presented with reasons for his arrest or any criminal charges. The arrests were part of a larger operation in the city of Nampo directed against the descendants of landowners and other “class enemies”. Altogether 300 people were crammed into train carriages and sent to Political Prison Camp No. 18. The witness was released in 2006 when Camp No. 18 was closed. 
1969	Ms Kim Young-soon, a former professional dancer, was a good friend of Song Hae-rim, who later became Kim Jong-il’s third wife and the mother to his first-born son Kim Jong-Nam. Ms Kim Young-soon knew about the relationship in 1969 when it was still a state secret.
1970	In 1970, her husband disappeared. One month later, the State Security Department arrested her. She was detained and interrogated in an informal secret detention facility over two months about what she knew about Song Hae-rim. Ms Kim came to understand that officials were afraid of her disclosing information about the relationship between Song Hae-rim and Kim Jong-il. After the interrogation was completed, Ms Kim were detained at Camp No. 15 at Yodok without trial or any explanation, until 1979. Ms Kim’s parents and her four children (aged 3, 5, 7 and 10 when they disappeared) were sent to Yodok with her. Both her parents and one of her sons died in the camp. At Political Prison Camp No. 15, Ms Kim met another woman who had been sent to the camp because she had assisted Song Hae-rim in giving birth to Kim Jong-Nam.

At Political Prison Camp No. 15, Ms Kim met another woman who had been sent to the camp because she had assisted Song Hae-rim in giving birth to Kim Jong-Nam. 
1950	In the past, many prisoners of war and civilians abducted during the Korean War, who refused to be quiet about their past and accept their fate of being denied their right to repatriation, ended up in the prison camps (see below). Many of those ethnic Koreans who returned from Japan in the 1950s and 1960s. disappeared into political prison camps, because the authorities felt that they might spread subversive information about what they had seen abroad.

Many of those ethnic Koreans who returned from Japan in the 1950s and 1960s. disappeared into political prison camps, because the authorities felt that they might spread subversive information about what they had seen abroad.
1989	The same fate was suffered by a large number of young citizens of the DPRK who had studied in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union around 1989 and witnessed the emergence of democracy in those countries after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
1960	Mr Kang Chol-hwan’s paternal grandparents, moved from Japan to the DPRK in the 1960s to help build the country.
1977	In 1977, his grandfather suddenly disappeared. Soon after, Mr Kang (then 9 years old) was arrested and taken, without indictment or trial, to Political Prison Camp No. 15.
1970	Ms Kim Young-soon described how her family was only provided with corn and salt, when they were incarcerated at Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok in the 1970s. Her father starved to death. Kim Young-soon said she always ran to her work because if she was late her food rations were cut. Even if she had broken bones she still needed to run to her work to avoid having her rations cut. Their rations were so little of it that the families hunted snakes and rodents to secure the survival of their young children.
1980	Food rations were provided once a month and usually consisted of corn kernels that lasted no longer than half the month, even though the food situation in the remainder of the DPRK was good at the time of his incarceration in the 1980s
1982	Mr Shin Dong-hyuk, born in 1982 in Camp No. 14, testified that he was always hungry during his detention, because there was never enough food. 
1990	Even before the famine of the 1990s, Ms Kim Hye-sook’s family of seven only received 4.5 kilograms of dried corn per month, so that they had to augment their diet to survive Political Prison Camp No. 18. 
2001	According to information provided by the DPRK to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2001, there were three prison facilities, which housed 1,153 inmates at the end of 1998, 3,049 at the end of 1999 and 1,426 at the end of 2000.
1998	According to information provided by the DPRK to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2001, there were three prison facilities, which housed 1,153 inmates at the end of 1998, 3,049 at the end of 1999 and 1,426 at the end of 2000.

2000	According to information provided by the DPRK to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2001, there were three prison facilities, which housed 1,153 inmates at the end of 1998, 3,049 at the end of 1999 and 1,426 at the end of 2000.
1997	In 1997, another inmate of Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 12 was forced to watch the execution of a man who attempted to escape. After the execution was over, the prison’s director had his driver tie a rope around the neck of the dead prisoner. The other end of the rope was tied to the back of a car. The car drove four times around the prison court yard, dragging the body behind it. All inmates had to watch this brutal spectacle, which was meant to serve as a warning against future escape attempts.
1999	During his imprisonment at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 9 at Hamhung, the witness was assigned to work as a “medical apprentice”. In this role he came to know that 480 out of 1200 inmates who were held there in the winter of 1999/2000 died over the course of six months. 
1997	A former prisoner remembered that in 1997 and 1998, around 500 inmates died from a typhoid epidemic in Kyohwaso No. 12 at Jonggo-ri. 
1998	A former prisoner remembered that in 1997 and 1998, around 500 inmates died from a typhoid epidemic in Kyohwaso No. 12 at Jonggo-ri. 
1990	The most common among the short-term prisons are called “labour training camps” (rodongdanryundae). They started being set up from the 1990s, in accordance with an order from Kim Jong-il that correctional facilities for misdemeanours should be established by local authorities at the county level. 
1998	The DPRK generally does not provide statistics on the number of executions carried out. In response to a question of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the DPRK stated in October 2001 that only 13 executions were carried out between 1998 and 2001 and that the last public execution dated back to October 1992.
1992	The DPRK generally does not provide statistics on the number of executions carried out. In response to a question of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the DPRK stated in October 2001 that only 13 executions were carried out between 1998 and 2001 and that the last public execution dated back to October 1992.
1990	Public executions were particularly common in the DPRK during the 1990s in line with orders from Kim Jong-il aimed at halting the breakdown of social order and state control. Many victims were executed for economic crimes such as embezzling goods from state factories or stealing food in order to survive. In many cases, the accused were summarily executed without trial. It was common that the victim’s body was left at the execution site for a time, as a warning. 
1990	A man described how the way in which public executions were carried out, became more brutal in the late 1990s. When he saw his first execution as a nine-year old boy in Bukchang, South Hamgyong in the 1980s, the victim was placed in wooden frame covered with cloth. That way only the silhouette of the slumping body could be seen.

That way only the silhouette of the slumping body could be seen.
1999	On one single occasion in July 1999, another witness recalled, KPA Military Security executed 12 persons in Hyesan for alleged anti-state activities, including the head of the city’s management department. The entire population of Hyesan was required to gather and witness the public execution. 
1998	From 1998, a large number of prisoners of Political Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 12 at Jonggo-ri were secretly executed. The victims were mostly people who had bad songbun and/or had been imprisoned for politically sensitive crimes. Some victims may also have been targeted because they complained about prison conditions or disobeyed orders. According to eyewitness testimony, the victims were taken out of their cell at night and brought one after the other to a room, where prison camp officials and an MPS officer from Pyongyang presented the victim with false accusations. Immediately thereafter, prison guards strangled the victim to death using a metal wire. Work unit leaders from among the prisoners were assigned to remove the bodies and take them to a furnace located a few kilometres away from the main prison block. Such killings occurred at regular intervals, and every time several prisoners were killed.
1997	In 1997, secret executions targeting perpetrators of politically sensitive crimes appear to have been carried out in an ordinary prison camp that was located in Taehun, South Pyongan Province and was closed later that year. Three to five victims per week were shot during the night or early morning at a site located about 1.5 km from the main prison block. 
1997	Both sets of secret executions could be linked to a directive that was allegedly issued by Kim Jong-il in 1997 and instructed the security apparatus to eliminate all elements who are “diseased in mind”.
1993	Between February 1993 and 1998, around 250 military officers who had studied at the Frunze Military Academy in the Soviet Union were reportedly executed. Some among them had apparently hatched plans to carry out a coup d’état. The purge was led by the KPA Military Security Command. The victims were executed without trial, after a determination of their guilt was made by security officials. The families of some victims were sent to political prison camps. Other families were apparently spared from collective punishment, because they represented some of the country’s most influential families.

1990	Public executions were most common in the 1990s. They became less common after 2000. However, they continue to be carried out today. Shortly before this report was finalized, there was an apparent spike in the number of politically motivated public executions. 
2012	A 2012 survey on detention and trial practices in the DPRK, conducted by the Korean Bar Association in the Republic of Korea, found that only 18.1 per cent of respondents were presented with an arrest warrant or other document justifying their detention at the time of their arrest. The majority never received any information concerning the reason of their arrest. Suspects are often not even informed orally about the reasons for their arrests.
2008	"	In 2008, SSD agents arrested the 20-year old son of a witness in Hoeryoung County, North Hamgyong Province. The victim had converted to Christianity and had been in contact with a Korean-American pastor in China. The men did not present a warrant and threatened the victim’s mother that she should not ask any questions about who they were and where they were taking her son. Two years later, the family heard from a personal contact in the SSD that the son had been interrogated for six months by the SSD in Hoeryoung and was eventually sent, without trial, to Political Prison Camp No. 16. The witness agonizes that he knows that is son is “as good as dead”. But he does not wish to lose hope of ever seeing him alive again. 
2005	In a positive legal development, the 2005 reform of the DPRK Code of Criminal Procedure introduced a time limit of two months during which the interrogation and related pre-trial detention must be concluded. With the approval of the Office of the Prosecutor, this period can be extended, in exceptional cases, to four months. For ordinary crimes handled by the MPS, these time periods are usually respected. 
2006	Mr Ji Seong-ho testified that his father was arrested as he tried to escape across the Tumen River to China. In November 2006, Mr Ji’s father died as a result of injuries sustained inflicted through torture, at the hand of SSD agents. When it became apparent that he would not survive, SSD agents wheeled him with a cart to his home and dumped him there even though no one was home to take care of him. Neighbours later found him dead.
2011	In August 2011, SSD agents arrested the 17-year old son of the witness in Hoeryoung City, North Hamgyong Province for watching South Korean movies. He was so badly tortured that his left ankle was shattered and his face was bruised and grossly disfigured. The SSD only released him after the family raised a large bribe. Shortly after his release, the boy died from a brain haemorrhage from which he suffered as a result of the beatings endured under interrogation
2001	In 2001, the witness and other inmates were beaten at an SSD Interrogation Centre in North Hamgyong Province, including by smashing her head against the wall. One man from her group of detainees died from the injuries sustained. Considering that the witness was forced to dig shallow mass graves she inferred that more inmates must have been dying in other cells. 
2004	In 2004, the witness, a young woman, was forcibly repatriated from China and detained at the SSD Interrogation Detention Centre in Onsong (North Hamgyong Province). She suffered there from severe vaginal bleeding and pain due to an undetected ectopic (extra-uterine) pregnancy. Despite her pleas, she received no medical assistance. She was not even allowed to keep her sanitary napkins. She was also beaten when she asked to be seated further away from the cell’s defecation hole, because the stench made her nauseous. . When her health situation became critical, she managed to bribe her way out of detention using money that other cellmates had managed to hide. Doctors at the local hospital gave her no chance of survival. Still, she miraculously recovered. The witness saw other detainees dying from starvation and water-borne diseases. She also observed how a man with a heart condition collapsed during physical strenuous exercise and lay motionless. The guards later dragged the man away and he was not seen again.  
2006	SSD agents interrogated and tortured an elderly woman at the same detention centre in Onsong in 2006. The torture and starvation she endured aggravated her pre-existing liver disease. The woman was denied medical attention in an attempt to force her brother to return from China and turn himself in to the SSD. After 15 days at the interrogation centre, the woman died.  
2011	In February 2011, the witness was repatriated from China. After enduring 12 days of beatings and interrogations by the SSD, she was handed over to the MPS. During two months of detention in an MPS interrogation detention Center, she and other inmates were beaten with various objects, in particular during interrogations. People who fainted during an interrogation session were accused of faking their unconsciousness and made to start again. Although she paid bribes in exchange for more lenient treatment, the witness was still subjected to beatings with wheelbarrow handles, gun barrels and pieces of wood. Detainees had to engage in forced labour during the day. Two men were beaten to death because they had not reached their work targets. A woman starved to death. While in their cells, inmates had to sit still the entire time in a cross legged position with their hands on their knees. If they moved, they would be forced to do headstands and squats or they were beaten. Some guards took advantage of the coercive setting to rape female inmates, who were taken to a nearby field for “questioning”.
2005	Political Prison Camp No.14 covers 150 square kilometres of a mountainous area near Kaechon City in South Pyongan Province. It appears to have been in existence since the 1960s and was transferred to its present location in the early 1980s. All inmates are incarcerated for life. Only one prisoner is known to have successfully escaped the camp – Mr Shin Dong-hyuk who testified publicly before the Commission. According to what can be seen on satellite images, the camp appears to have been expanded since his escape in 2005. 
2006	A detention facility often referred to as Political Prison Camp No. 25 is located near Chongjin City, North Hamgyong Province. While Political Camps No. 14, 15 and 16 each have tens of thousands of prisoners, Camp No. 25 has a population of a few thousand prisoners. It also distinguishes itself from the other camps, because it looks more like a maximum security prison with a main block surrounded by high walls. Its prisoners are incarcerated for life without trial on political grounds, which is why Camp No. 25 can be considered a political prison camp. In recent years, Camp No. 25 has been expanded. It almost doubled in surface-size since 2006 and now covers an area of 980 square metres. 
2012	From the 1960s until its closure in mid-2012, the SSD operated Political Prison Camp No. 22 near Hoeryong (North Hamgyong Province). The authorities are believed to have closed the camp, because of its proximity to the Chinese border, which increased the risk of successful escapes and of information about the Camp being transmitted to the outside world. 
2009	Before the closure process was started in 2009 or 2010, Camp No. 22 was believed to have had 30,000-50,000 inmates. There is no information that any inmates of Camp No. 22 were released. The Commission has not been able to establish the fate of the large numbers of prisoners that remain unaccounted for. 
2010	Before the closure process was started in 2009 or 2010, Camp No. 22 was believed to have had 30,000-50,000 inmates. There is no information that any inmates of Camp No. 22 were released. The Commission has not been able to establish the fate of the large numbers of prisoners that remain unaccounted for. 
2009	Observers offer divergent opinions on what happened to the prisoners of Camp No. 22. Some take the view that the prisoners of camp 22 were distributed between camps 14, 15 and 16. . Others have indicated that satellite imagery from other camps does not suggest any new construction of a scale that would support the inflow of the entire population of Political Prison Camp No. 22. They also presented allegations that food supplies were diverted from Camp No. 22 in 2009 and 2010, which caused a large number of the inmates to starve to death.

2006	Until 2006, the Ministry of People’s Security and its predecessor, the Social Safety Agency, also managed political prison camps, subject to oversight by the State Security Department and the Workers’ Party of Korea. Although the MPS camps did not share all features of the existing camps (e.g. the prohibition of marriage), these camps were similar to the currently existing camps in that inmates suffered enforced disappearance and were imprisoned without trial in conditions of starvation and forced labour. 
2006	It appears that Political Prison Camp No. 18 was gradually downsized until the site in Bukchang, South was closed down in 2006. 
2000	Later estimates, which were provided by non-governmental organizations, based on satellite images and testimony from guards and prisoners who were in the camps in the 1990s or early 2000s, range from 150,000-200,000 inmates.
2011	These figures are also in line with a 2011 estimate of the Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB), which placed the size of the camp population at a minimum of 130,500 people, but did not yet account for the closure of Camp No. 22 and the related uncertainty about the fate of the prisoners of Camp No. 22. 
2001	In 2001, as Political Prison Camp No. 18 was downsizing, she was released. From a relative she found out that the family had been punished because her grandfather had fled to the Republic of Korea during the Korean War.
2006	Altogether 300 people were crammed into train carriages and sent to Political Prison Camp No. 18. The witness was released in 2006 when Camp No. 18 was closed. 
2005	In 2005, a college professor from Pyongyang and his entire family were sent to Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok. The man had told colleagues that Kim Jong-il had been born in Russia (and not on Mount Paektu, as his official biography claims). He had picked up this information after illegally listening to a short wave radio broadcast produced in the Republic of Korea. The entire family disappeared, except for one daughter, who had already married into another family.
2000	Mr Jeong Kwang-il was also detained in the revolutionizing zone of Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok from 2000-2003. Coming from a privileged family, he had the opportunity to engage in trading in China. In order to increase the profit margins for his company, he began selling goods directly to buyers from the ROK, instead of going through Chinese intermediaries. When such prohibited contacts were reported by informants to the State Security Department, Mr Jeong was arrested. He was interrogated under torture for six months until he agreed to confess falsely to having engaged in espionage for the ROK. After surviving three years of starvation and forced labour, in Political Prison Camp No. 15, Mr Jeong was released.
2003	Mr Jeong Kwang-il was also detained in the revolutionizing zone of Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok from 2000-2003. Coming from a privileged family, he had the opportunity to engage in trading in China. In order to increase the profit margins for his company, he began selling goods directly to buyers from the ROK, instead of going through Chinese intermediaries. When such prohibited contacts were reported by informants to the State Security Department, Mr Jeong was arrested. He was interrogated under torture for six months until he agreed to confess falsely to having engaged in espionage for the ROK. After surviving three years of starvation and forced labour, in Political Prison Camp No. 15, Mr Jeong was released.
2007	Mr A testified that in 2007, his older sister was sent to Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok after being forcibly repatriated from China. The State Security Department (SSD) considered her case particularly grave, because she had been arrested while trying to reach Mongolia and from there the Republic of Korea. 
2008	One witness described how his son had adopted the Christian religion and repeatedly travelled to China, where he received religious instruction from a Korean-American pastor. At the end of 2008, the son’s contacts with the pastor were discovered, because SSD agents in China had the pastor under surveillance. The son was arrested by the State Security Department. After interrogation, the son was sent to a political prison camp and has not been seen since.
2009	In July 2009, the witness and three other persons were engaged in an operation to help two elderly citizens from the ROK, prisoners of war from the Korean War, escape the DPRK across the border to China. 
2007	In 2007, the witness escaped from the DPRK. Subsequently, the witness’s parents were arrested, interrogated and eventually sent to Camp No. 15, even though they were not involved in the escape of witness. Prior to the escape, the family had already been classified as politically suspect since they were ethnic Koreans who had migrated from Japan. 
2012	In 2012, the State Security Department carried out a major operation in Hoeryoung (North Hamgyong Province) against a group involved in smuggling mobile phones, cameras and small radios into the DPRK. The group was falsely framed as planning sabotage activities in the DPRK. 
2013	In the aftermath of the December 2013 execution of Jang Song-thaek, the uncle-in-marriage to Kim Jong-un, allegations have emerged indicating that security officials arrested members of his extended family and transferred them to political prison camps. 
2007	Since 2007, there are no known cases of people being released from Political Prison Camp No. 15. Some observers therefore fear that the entire Political Prison Camp No. 15 has been turned into a total control zone to preclude the possibility of further witnesses emerging from the prison camp.
2001	 In August 2001, a male inmate had left his group to look for food because he was so hungry. He then went into hiding, because leaving one's group is considered an escape attempt, which is punishable by death. When the guards found him after three days, they publicly executed him. 
2003	In March 2003, another man left his work unit to take some potatoes from the storage, because he was extremely hungry. Fearing that the guards would try to consider this an attempted escape, he tried to hide. The guards chased tracker dogs after him. The dogs found and mauled the man until he was half dead. Then the guards shot the victim dead on the spot. 
2007	A former political prisoner, who was detained from 2007 to 2010 in the revolutionizing zone of Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok, witnessed two cases, in which women who became pregnant without authorization were forced to have an abortion. The victim’s term of imprisonment at Yodok was also extended. One of the cases was a late term abortion, carried out through an injection that induced premature labour. The witness herself was forced to help the victim deliver the dead foetus.
2010	A former political prisoner, who was detained from 2007 to 2010 in the revolutionizing zone of Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok, witnessed two cases, in which women who became pregnant without authorization were forced to have an abortion. The victim’s term of imprisonment at Yodok was also extended. One of the cases was a late term abortion, carried out through an injection that induced premature labour. The witness herself was forced to help the victim deliver the dead foetus.
2003	Mr Jeong Kwang-il and Mr Kim Eun-chol, detained from 2003 in Camp No. 15, said that prisoners were only given 120 grams of corn porridge three times a day. On special days, they received a piece of pork in their soup. Rations were halved if workers did not perform well.
2001	According to information provided by the DPRK to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2001, there were three prison facilities, which housed 1,153 inmates at the end of 1998, 3,049 at the end of 1999 and 1,426 at the end of 2000.
2000	According to information provided by the DPRK to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2001, there were three prison facilities, which housed 1,153 inmates at the end of 1998, 3,049 at the end of 1999 and 1,426 at the end of 2000.
2005	In 2005, the DPRK reported to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) that in March 2005, only 40 women were imprisoned in reform institutions following conviction. 
2009	The prison has an estimated 3,000-4,000 inmates, including about 1,000 female prisoners who have been housed in a separate building since 2009. Kyohwaso No. 12 operates a copper mine, as well as logging and farming enterprises.
2008	In 2008, the entire prison complex reportedly housed around 12,000 male and female prisoners, four times as many as its intended capacity. The prison camp operates a coal mine and various factories.
2006	Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 22 at Oro, Yongkwang County (South Hamgyong Province) is a smaller facility that was upgraded from a labour training facility to a regular prison camp in 2006. Its male and female inmates are mostly forced to work in farming. 
2007	Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 88, located in Chuksan Village, Wonsan City (Kangwon Province), is said to have about 2,000 prisoners. Since 2007, it also houses female inmates. 
2012	The abovementioned 2012 survey of persons who fled the DPRK, which was carried out by the Korean Bar Association in the Republic of Korea, found that only 19 per cent of the respondents who underwent a criminal trial met their lawyer before the trial. Only 5 per cent believed their lawyer was of any help. In only 57 per cent of trials both the prosecutor and the defence attorney were in attendance. In 81 per cent of cases, the courts called no witnesses in favour of the defendant. Only 54 per cent were allowed to make a final statement in line with article 330 of the DPRK Code of Criminal Procedure. Almost half of all respondents (46 per cent) were subject to a closed trial.
2011	Another witness, who was incarcerated in the same prison until 2011, added that inmates who did not receive blankets from their families had to make their own from their own clothes. The cells were infested with bugs and lice and infectious diseases spread easily.
2005	In a 2005 submission to the Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the DPRK contended that female inmates only work in workshops that produce such items as clothes, shoes or bags, for which they are remunerated. While the Commission has not received any information about women having to engage in mining in the ordinary prison system, it received numerous credible accounts from female inmates that they had to engage, without pay, in backbreaking work in forestry and farming. 
2011	A female inmate, who was detained at Kyohwaso No. 12 until 2011, had to do hard farming work. However, the food produced in the farms was used to feed the guards. The small rations left her so hungry that she ate different types of grass, wild mushrooms and tree bark to survive. A number of times, she saw other inmates being beaten for stealing food. 
2010	Similar hard farming work was also forced on another woman, who was detained at Kyohwaso No. 12 until the end of 2010. The guards always watched the hungry prisoner to make sure that they did not take any of the corn they had to grow. When the female prisoners concluded their work at around 7 p.m. in the evening, they still had to sit through long indoctrination sessions emphasizing the greatness of Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung.
2004	Another witness, imprisoned at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 11 in Cheungsan from 2004 to 2007, recounted that it was established prison policy to summarily execute anyone caught trying to escape. The witness saw several executions of such prisoners.
2007	Another witness, imprisoned at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 11 in Cheungsan from 2004 to 2007, recounted that it was established prison policy to summarily execute anyone caught trying to escape. The witness saw several executions of such prisoners.
2011	According to another man who was detained at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 12 until 2011, prisoners who tried to run away were shot to death while trying to escape. The witness did not see any summary executions of those caught alive. Such inmates were reassigned to harsh work that likely caused them to die. Each prisoner was also partnered up with another prisoner and ordered to watch the other. In case one attempted to escape, the other prisoner was also punished.
2004	Another witness related the case of a fellow inmate forced to have an abortion while the witness was imprisoned at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 12 from 2004-2011.
2011	Another witness related the case of a fellow inmate forced to have an abortion while the witness was imprisoned at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 12 from 2004-2011.
2000	During his imprisonment at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 9 at Hamhung, the witness was assigned to work as a “medical apprentice”. In this role he came to know that 480 out of 1200 inmates who were held there in the winter of 1999/2000 died over the course of six months. 
2011	A former male inmate confirmed that the practice of burning the dead collectively and using their ashes as fertilizer carried on at Ordinary Prison Camp (kyohwaso) No. 12 was still ongoing when he was released in 2011.
2009	Another former inmate experienced a second typhoid epidemic that ravaged in that prison in the winter of 2009/2010. So many people died that entire work units ceased to function. She contracted typhoid herself and got so weak that the guards dumped her in the room assigned for inmates who were considered close to death. She thinks she survived only because she licked the icy water from the windows to bring down her fever. When it was discovered she was still alive she was sent back to her cell. Only later was she provided with medication that helped her survive. 
2010	Another former inmate experienced a second typhoid epidemic that ravaged in that prison in the winter of 2009/2010. So many people died that entire work units ceased to function. She contracted typhoid herself and got so weak that the guards dumped her in the room assigned for inmates who were considered close to death. She thinks she survived only because she licked the icy water from the windows to bring down her fever. When it was discovered she was still alive she was sent back to her cell. Only later was she provided with medication that helped her survive. 
2010	Shocked by what the witness saw, the witness made an enquiry with the MPS Corrections Bureau in 2010 and was informed that more than 800 inmates per year were dying in Kyohwaso No. 4.
2012	In a comprehensive 2012 study, the Database Center for Human Rights in North Korea identified 49 labour training camps administered by the MPS and two by the KPA Military Security Command. The true number might be a lot higher considering that such facilities were to be established at the level of every county.
2009	In 2009, the witness, a young woman from Hyesan (Ryanggang Province), was denounced by her friend, because she had secretly watched movies produced in the ROK. Four MPS officers interrogated her until 3 a.m. in the morning and slapped her face until she admitted to her “crime”. 
2004	In 2004, the witness was imprisoned in a labour training facility following her interrogation by the SSD in Sinuiju. She was forced to do farming and logging work starting at 5a.m. She received a lump of maize and five pieces of pickled radish per day.
2000	In 2000, the witness spent six months of imprisonment in an all-female labour training camp in North Hamgyong. There were 30 to 40 inmates crammed into a 28square metres cell. They had to sleep on the straw covered floor. The prison only supplied raw corn and salted soup. However, family members were allowed to visit and bring food. She had to carry sandbags and rocks. At night, inmates were also forced to march and run. Those who did not do well were beaten.
2004	The 2004 reform of the DPRK Criminal Code reduced the number of crimes that are subject to the death penalty in the DPRK. However, the Criminal Code’s remaining death penalty provisions still cover a wide range of conduct that extends far beyond the ‘most serious crimes’ to which article 6 ICCPR limits the application of the death penalty.
2007	Since 2007, the scope of crimes subject to the death penalty has been once again expanded. In September 2007, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly adopted an ordinance that contains an annex to the Criminal Code with new offences. Sixteen of the new offences are subject to the death penalty. In accordance with the decree, economic crimes such as “extremely grave” cases of smuggling precious metals or intentionally destroying state property are now subject to the death penalty. Most disturbingly, the 2007 decree contains a “catch all” clause, allowing for the sentence of death where a perpetrator commits multiple particularly grave crimes and the court considers that the perpetrator cannot be rehabilitated. 
2009	In 2009, the Ministry of People’s Security issued a proclamation on behalf of the Government of the DPRK that prohibits various types of illegal trading in foreign currency. The proclamation envisages harsh criminal sanctions, including the death penalty. The same year, the death penalty was also extended to the crime of “disloyal destruction for anti-state purposes” under article 64 of the Criminal Code.
2001	The DPRK generally does not provide statistics on the number of executions carried out. In response to a question of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the DPRK stated in October 2001 that only 13 executions were carried out between 1998 and 2001 and that the last public execution dated back to October 1992.
2005	The Korea Institute for National Unification documented 510 public executions that it found to have taken place between 2005 and 2012 by gathering testimony from persons who fled the DPRK. The real number is probably even higher considering that relatively few people manage to depart from the provinces located farther from the Chinese border. 
2012	The Korea Institute for National Unification documented 510 public executions that it found to have taken place between 2005 and 2012 by gathering testimony from persons who fled the DPRK. The real number is probably even higher considering that relatively few people manage to depart from the provinces located farther from the Chinese border. 
2000	From 2000, after the social situation had somewhat improved and the state could ease the level of repression, fewer public executions were reported. 
2009	During the course of its Universal Periodic Review in December 2009, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea admitted itself that public executions were still being carried out in very exceptional cases involving very brutal crimes. 
2013	In December 2013, the authorities executed Mr. Jang Song-thaek, the uncle by marriage to the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Until shortly before his death, Jang Song-thaek was the head of the Administration Department of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. 
2013	In November 2013, Mr Ri Riong-ha, First Deputy Director of the Administration Department and Mr Jang Su-gil, Deputy Director of the Administration Department were reportedly executed on the basis of a judgment of the Special Military Court of the State Security Department.
2014	In the same direction points the 2014 New Year’s statement of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, in which he indicated that the Party “took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists lurking in the Party”. 
2013	The Commission received reports about a series of public executions conducted in August, October and November 2013 in various locations across the country. Many of the victims were reportedly executed for having been involved in the distribution of foreign movies and pornographic material. Most of the reported executions occurred after unconfirmed rumours were widely published in international media, which sought to link Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-ju to a pornography-related scandal.
2010	In early 2010, a number of officials involved in the disastreous 2009 currency reform were executed. At the time that the executions were carried out, Kim Jong-un had already started gradually assuming affairs of state from his ailing father Kim Jong-il.

2013	In March 2013, the inhabitants of Songpyeong area of Chongjin City (North Hamgyong Province) were ordered to watch the execution of a man and a woman. Both adults and children had to attend, without exception. After an official announced to the crowd that the victims had produced and sold large amounts of methamphetamine, the victims were beaten and tied to a pole. Then a firing squad of six officials executed them using machine guns. Other public executions were conducted in the same place in 2007 (for human trafficking), 2008 (for theft from a state factory) and 2009 (for murder).

2012	In the spring of 2012, a woman was publicly executing for having killed her lover in Bukchang County, South Pyongan Province. 
2011	"	In November 2011, four persons were publicly executed for having produced and sold drugs in Kyonghung County, North Hamgyong Province."
2011	In June 2011, people were forced to watch the public execution of a woman for murder in Kumya County, South Hamgyong Province. 
2010	In 2010, a woman who had sold movies and soap operas produced in the ROK was publicly executed in Hamhung, also South Hamgyong.
2009	In October 2009, a man was publicly executed in Hoeryoung, North Hamgyong Province for having been in contact with ROK authorities.
2007	In 2007, two men were executed in Political Prison Camp No. 15 at Yodok according to a former inmate. The men had left their living areas, because they were starving and wanted to find food in the mountains. After a large search operation was mounted by the camp authorities, the men were found and summarily executed in front of the other inmates.
2000	As a matter of State policy, the authorities carry out executions – with or without trial; publicly or secretly – to punish political and other crimes that are often not among the most serious crimes. The policy of regularly carrying out public executions serves to instil fear in the general population. Public executions were most common in the 1990s. They became less common after 2000. However, they continue to be carried out today. Shortly before this report was finalized, there was an apparent spike in the number of politically motivated public executions.

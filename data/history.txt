1943	As the end of World War II approached, the matter of the disposition of colonies around the world became subject to negotiation by the soon-to-be victorious powers. The United States of America suggested a multi-lateral trusteeship for Korea in its general preference for the establishment of gradual independence processes. In 1943, in anticipation of Japan’s defeat, the Allied Powers at the Cairo Conference set out an agreement for the independence of Korea “in due course”
1945	Before 1945, Protestant Christians were a politically active and substantial population but many departed North Korea. The remaining population was often subject to suspicion. Many were arrested, imprisoned or executed.
1945	It is estimated that by 1945, 20 per cent of all Koreans had been displaced from their places of origin, with 11 per cent displaced outside Korea. At the end of World War II, there were approximately 2.4 million Koreans in Japan, 2 million in China and about 200,000 in the Soviet Union. After Japan’s defeat in World War II, the colonial administration collapsed. Millions of displaced Koreans sought to return home while others stayed behind in Japan, China and the Soviet Union. The legacy of this forced displacement includes substantial minority populations of Koreans, particularly in Japan and northern China
1945	In 1945, the United States decided on the 38th parallel to divide the Korean peninsula into two zones of control, one under an American sphere of influence and the other under a Soviet one. The United States sent 25,000 troops to South Korea in fulfilment of these arrangements. They were often met with resentment and resistance. In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent its 25th Army to North Korea where it set up the Soviet Civil Administration. 
1945	When the Soviet Union decided against retaining Cho Man-sik as the local leader, Kim Il-sung was selected as an alternate candidate. On 14 October 1945, Kim Il-sung spoke publicly for the first time to a mass rally in honour of the Soviet Army. He was introduced by Soviet General Lebedev as a “national hero” and an “outstanding guerrilla leader”. Nevertheless, Kim Il-sung was only one of three North Koreans who spoke at the event. He was not the most senior of them as Cho Man-sik remained the head of the Administrative Committee of the Five Provinces, the first proto-government established by the Soviets. In December 1945, however, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States and United Kingdom met in Moscow where they agreed to a joint trusteeship of Korea for five years. Nationalists in Seoul staged rallies against the decision
1946	Cho Man-sik, likewise, refused to sign the declaration of support of trusteeship in January 1946.
1946	By 1946, the Soviet Civil Administration devolved authority to the local administration. Kim Il-sung was made head of the Provisional People’s Committee of North Korea. There was less resistance to the Soviet Union’s influence in the North than there was to the United States in the South. In March 1946, the Provisional People’s Committee issued a Land Reform Law which was signed by Kim Il-sung. Land belonging to Japanese entities and individuals as well as large landowners was confiscated and redistributed to former peasant tenants. The land reform in the North was generally successful and helped to strengthen the position of the new regime. In August 1946, the Provisional People’s Committee nationalized industry. Technically, only Japanese owners and Korean collaborators were subject to confiscation, but this effectively included all large and most medium sized industries. Efforts to promote national culture and education were also popular with the people. 
1947	In 1947, the DPRK launched its first economic plan
1946	In 1946, former Soviet police officer Pang Hak-se was appointed to head the Section on Political Defence of the state within the Security Department, which was the first organization for the political police and counter-intelligence. Pang Hak-se is credited as the founder of the North Korean political police. Despite coming from the Soviet Korean Faction, and not from Kim Il-sung’s own Guerrilla Faction, he maintained lifelong loyalty to him
1946	In 1946, there was a consolidation of all political groups into the North Korean Workers’ Party. The North Korean armed forces were also organized and reinforced. They were trained and equipped by the Soviet military although initially they were disguised as police and railway defence units. 
1948	By the time the DPRK was established in September 1948, Kim Il-sung was firmly in position as the head of the Cabinet of Ministers (or Premier). Soviet forces then withdrew in large numbers from the DPRK. 
1949	In 1949, the DPRK instituted compulsory military service, bringing the total number of troops to between 150,000 and 200,000, organized into ten infantry divisions, one tank division and one air force division. This large military force was equipped with Soviet weapons, including T-34 tanks and Yak fighter planes. These forces were further bolstered by the return of 45,000 war-hardened Korean soldiers from China following the end of the civil war there
1945	Between 1945 and 1948, the 38th parallel turned into a heavily guarded border, while both sides of the divided peninsula contemplated the use of military force to achieve reunification. 
1948	Tensions and military provocations increased after the respective departures of Soviet and United States forces in 1948
1949	In 1949, Kim Il-sung secured his designation as Suryong, Supreme Leader. In order to eliminate any opposition to his rule, he established a system of governance built on an elaborate guiding ideology, a single mass party led by a single person, a centrally-planned economy, a monopoly on the means of communication, and a system of security that employed violence and a political police. As a matter of priority, the DPRK built up its state security apparatus. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, modelled on the Soviet security system, with 4,000 to 5,000 headquarters staff, was comprised of 12,000 regular police, 3,000 political police, and 45,000 employees within the Security Guard units, Border Constabulary and Railroad Brigade. The Political Security Bureau within the Ministry was responsible for ensuring loyalty to the regime by uncovering and stopping resistance to authority and subversive activities. The Political Security Bureau also provided operational guidance to the Political Defence Bureau within the Ministry of Defence, which carried out the same functions within the military. The security system also employed an informant network of 400,000 people, an estimated 5 per cent of the population at that time
1950	On 25 June 1950, Kim Il-sung, after finally securing support from both Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, initiated the Korean War by sending up to 90,000 Korean People’s Army troops over the 38th parallel in a multi-pronged attack that surprised both the ROK authorities and their United States advisors. Kim Il-sung was staking his claim to the leadership of the entire peninsula based on the perceived illegitimacy of the ROK leadership and expectations of insurgency in the South. Initially, the Korean People’s Army easily overwhelmed the forces of the ROK, which numbered fewer than 100,000 men. The capital Seoul fell in three days.
1950	United States President Harry S. Truman interpreted the attack by the DPRK on the ROK as the first major test of the Cold War. He quickly ordered the deployment of United States troops while seeking endorsement of his actions from the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council had initially adopted a United States-led resolution calling for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of North Korean forces to beyond the 38th parallel with a vote of 9 to 0 with three abstentions. The Soviet Union was not present to exercise its veto as a Permanent Member of the Security Council
1950	The Soviet Union had been refusing to participate in the Security Council since January 1950 over the issue of the accreditation of China. China’s seat in the United Nations was still held by the representative of the Republic of China, based in Taiwan, despite the defeat of Nationalist forces on the mainland. On 27 June 1950, President Truman ordered United States air and naval forces to support the ROK. Security Council Resolution 83, adopted on the same day, determined that “the armed attack upon the Republic of Korea by forces from North Korea constitutes a breach of the peace”. It recommended that United Nations members “furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area”. On 7 July 1950, the Security Council further recommended that all members providing military forces and other assistance do so under the unified command of the United States and authorized “the unified command at its discretion to use the United Nations flag in the course of operations against North Korean forces concurrently with the flags of the various nations participating.” Fifteen states, in addition to the United States, contributed combat units to fight in the “international field force” under the United Nations Command. In August 1950, the Soviet Union returned to the Security Council and vetoed all further resolutions concerning the Korean War. The debate on Korea then shifted to the United Nations General Assembly
1950	The ensuing months yielded a string of successes for the forces of the DPRK. By the end of August 1950, the DPRK’s military controlled 90 per cent of the Korean peninsula. However, an amphibious landing of United States troops under General Douglas MacArthur in Incheon in September 1950 turned the tide. With the support of the United Nations now behind them, the ROK forces marched northward and recaptured Seoul. General MacArthur pushed UN-backed forces up to the Chinese border despite warnings from the Chinese. By November 1950, the ROK supported by the United Nations Command controlled 90 per cent of the peninsula. The People’s Republic of China then sent hundreds of thousands of troops to bolster the Korean People’s Army. They succeeded in pushing United Nations and ROK forces back beyond the 38th parallel. The DPRK in its subsequent accounts of the war has minimized the decisive role played by the Chinese “volunteers”. Nevertheless, Chinese forces carried the main military burden for the rest of the war. The DPRK has consistently downplayed the extent of outside assistance that it received not only during the war but in rebuilding after the war and then sustaining its post-war economy. The counter-offensive by United Nations forces reduced the gains made by the Korean People’s Army and caused massive destruction in the North. Thereafter, two years of bitter stalemate ensued. During this time, more bombs were dropped on the DPRK than had been deployed in the entire Pacific theatre during World War II. The devastation caused to all parts of the Korean peninsula was enormous
1953	The Korean War ended in 1953 in a ceasefire. On 27 July 1953, the Armistice Agreement was signed by Lieutenant General of the United States Army William K. Harrison, Jr., for the United Nations Command, and General of the Korean People’s Army Nam Il for the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers. Over 2 million Koreans had been killed. Around 600,000 Chinese and over 36,000 United States combatants died. Other nationalities’ fatalities include over 1,000 from the United Kingdom, and hundreds from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, France, Greece, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey. Grave breaches of international humanitarian law were reportedly committed on both sides. United States military historian S.L.A. Marshall called the Korean War the “century’s nastiest little war”. It has also been referred to as the Forgotten War in the United States. The conflict, however, is far from forgotten in the DPRK where the war sacrifices were used to bolster the narrative of Kim Il-sung’s “forging of the nation”. In the DPRK, the authorized history remains that the Fatherland Liberation War was started by the United States, and that Kim Il-sung not only defended the nation but wrought devastation on the American military
1954	The 1954 Geneva Conference was attended by the Republic of Korea, the DPRK, China, the Soviet Union, and 16 of the 17 states that had contributed forces under the United Nations Command. After two months, these talks collapsed and have not resumed. There has not been a comprehensive peace treaty.
1954	The United States by 1954 was disassociating its forces from the United Nations Command and continued its engagement in the ROK through the United States-ROK Mutual Defence Treaty. At the same time, the other states that had committed troops to the United Nations Command withdrew most or all of their forces. The United States maintains a military presence in the ROK of about 28,500 people
1951	In 1951, Kim Il-sung reorganized the Ministry of Internal Affairs and transformed the Political Security Bureau into its own new ministry, the Ministry of Public Security, to suppress political opposition more effectively
1952	In December 1952, Kim Il-sung denounced factions in a long speech to the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party
1953	In 1953, rumours of an aborted coup attempt by the Domestic Faction led to the arrest of their leaders. Twelve members of this group, leaders of the South Korean Workers’ Party responsible for organizing guerrilla activities in the South, were charged with planning a coup and spying for the United States. On the basis of trials that were highly orchestrated and heavily publicized, ten were convicted and sentenced to death while two were given long prison sentences
1950	Kim Il-sung continued to face pressure within the leadership over his increasingly autocratic rule and emerging cult of personality as well as the direction of his economic policies. After 1953, the Soviet Union was itself undergoing a campaign of “de-Stalinization” that did not comport with Kim Il-sung’s efforts to consolidate his own rule. Instead, the Soviet Union was promoting collective leadership, peaceful co-existence and an end to the excesses of the Stalin era
1956	In August 1956, the members of the Yanan Faction openly criticized Kim Il-sung during the Party’s Central Committee Plenum. According to a Soviet account, one official “attacked Kim Il-Sung for concentrating entire state and Party power in his hands”. The leaders of the Yanan faction who had tried to orchestrate the “August Conspiracy” were out-maneuvered by Kim Il-sung who isolated them before purging the rank and file of the faction members
1957	On 30 May 1957, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea adopted the resolution “On the Transformation of the Struggle with Counter-Revolutionary Elements into an All-people All-Party movement” (May 30th Resolution) to evaluate the political background of every adult in the DPRK. These developments were to become a turning point for the DPRK. Earlier purges had differed in that they had targeted specific groups of people, such as landlords, Christians and high-ranking Party members who were potential rivals to Kim Il-sung. 
1958	This purge, lasting until 1960, resulted in thousands of executions, often in public. Pang Hak-se, the Minister of Public Security, told a Soviet diplomat that 100,000 people were exposed as “hostile and reactionary elements” between 1958 and 1959
1959	This purge, lasting until 1960, resulted in thousands of executions, often in public. Pang Hak-se, the Minister of Public Security, told a Soviet diplomat that 100,000 people were exposed as “hostile and reactionary elements” between 1958 and 1959
1960	This purge, lasting until 1960, resulted in thousands of executions, often in public. Pang Hak-se, the Minister of Public Security, told a Soviet diplomat that 100,000 people were exposed as “hostile and reactionary elements” between 1958 and 1959
1959	In 1959, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to the DPRK also reported to his capital that, “In recent times, the persecution of comrades who express a different opinion has been increased. They are being sent to rural areas, mines, hydropower dams and also into prison camps.” In order to sustain the large-scale purges of the late 1950s, a system of secret political prison camps was set up, which was later expanded
1957	In 1957, the DPRK instituted the Public Distribution System to provide food and to ration other goods. As the DPRK was highly urbanized, an estimated 60 to 70 per cent of the population relied on the state for these food distributions. The Public Distribution System suppressed private production and monopolized distribution of food and household necessities. The entire economic framework of the country, and in particular the Public Distribution System, became an important means of social, economic and political control
1958	In his March 1958 speech “For the Elaboration of the Judicial Policy of our Party”, Kim Il-sung explained that the dictatorial functions of the judicial, procuratorial and public security organs should be enhanced. He said that “the DPRK’s laws should serve as a weapon to champion socialism” and emphasized that “all the workers of the judicial organs should be true to the Party’s leadership and intensify the struggle against counter revolutionaries by firmly relying on the judicial policy of the Party”. According to official DPRK sources, Kim Jong-il carried on with the approach of making the justice system, and judges in particular, subject to the instructions of the Workers’ Party of Korea
1960	Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there were daily exchanges of fire along the demilitarized zone killing some 900 soldiers and civilians
1970	Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there were daily exchanges of fire along the demilitarized zone killing some 900 soldiers and civilians
1960	By the early 1960s, Kim Il-sung successfully suppressed public dissent. Any critical remark about the political or economic situation could, and not infrequently did, lead to imprisonment and worse. According to Russian observers who were in the DPRK at the time, arrests and even executions were imposed for an attitude deemed to be excessively warm towards the Soviet Union, as well as any positive remarks about the scientific, technical, or cultural achievements of other countries
1964	While the threat of these extreme human rights violations constituted a form of terror deployed against the general population, Kim Il-sung continued periodically to instigate purges within the leadership of the party and military. For example, in 1964, after the resolution “On Further Strengthening the Work with Various Groups and Strata of the Population” was adopted by the 8th Plenum of the Party’s Central Committee, a new campaign was launched to further refine the Songbun system
1960	In the 1960s, after Kim Il-sung had eliminated his potential rivals who were largely affiliated with the Chinese and Soviet factions, he actively distanced himself from the Soviet Union and China
1967	In 1967, the DPRK sought to destabilize the ROK by utilizing its secret services.
1968	In 1968, 31 men from Unit 124 of the DPRK’s special forces attempted to enter the Blue House in Seoul in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate President Park Chung-hee
1964	Between 1964 and 1969, this work was conducted by specially created groups. This exercise led to more people being exiled, arrested and executed as enemies of the regime
1969	Between 1964 and 1969, this work was conducted by specially created groups. This exercise led to more people being exiled, arrested and executed as enemies of the regime
1966	China by 1966 was in the throes of the Cultural Revolution which caused great human suffering and disruptions that threatened to spill over into the DPRK. As Kim Il-sung also reduced contact with the Soviet Union and East European socialist states, economic assistance from these countries, which had been substantial, likewise began to dwindle. At the same time, he expanded his cult of personality and set out a policy of self-reliance and extreme nationalism known as Juche. Kim Il-sung promoted the Juche ideology in conjunction with a policy to focus on military readiness under the Four Military Lines doctrine
1972	Nevertheless, in 1972, following secret negotiations between Kim Il-sung’s brother Kim Yong-ju and the ROK’s chief intelligence officer Yi Hu-rak, the ROK and DPRK released a joint statement on achieving reunification peacefully without the use of military force or external forces
1970	In the mid-1970s, per capita GNP in South and North Korea was about the same. Once assistance from outside dried up the DPRK did not have the skills or the political will to address its deeply rooted economic problems. For a brief period in the 1970s, the DPRK attempted to borrow funds from the international community. However, the state had no plans on how to re-pay these debts or how to invest these resources into the development of the country. DPRK went into default on billions of dollars and was unable to borrow further. 
1990	The choices that the leadership made over the years led to serious food shortages long before the famine of the 1990s
1970	Kim Jong-il had been serving in the Party’s powerful propaganda and organization departments until he organized the Fifth Party Congress in 1970 which proclaimed Juche as the monolithic ideology of the DPRK and further enhanced his father’s cult of personality thereby setting in motion the process for his succession. Around this time, Kim Jong-il introduced Kimilsungism, a concept linked to Juche. Kim Il-sung’s cult of personality became an important instrument of Kim Jong-il’s consolidation of his own succession, as his father was the main source of his legitimacy to rule the nation
1972	It was really in 1972 that the intensity of the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung surpassed those of Mao Zedong or Joseph Stalin. DPRK citizens began to wear badges with his picture in addition to hanging his portrait on their walls. 
1972	With the 1972 Constitution, Kim Jong-il reorganized the state administration and further expanded the state security apparatus. At this time, a new State Security Department was set up that reported directly to Kim Jong-il and supported the succession process
1974	Once the Central Committee elected Kim Jong-il to membership of the Politburo and endorsed his selection as Kim Il-sung’s heir in 1974, he deepened the ideological basis of the Suryong system. Kim Jong-il announced the “Ten Principles in Establishing Party’s Monolithic Ideological System” which called for “unconditional obedience” and “all our loyalty” to Kim Il-sung. Moreover, article 10.1 of the Ten Principles declares that “(t)he entire party and society will adhere strictly to the one-ideology system, and establish the one and only leadership of the Central Party so as to complete in shining glory revolutionary achievements of the Great Leader.” The “Central Party” was understood to mean Kim Jong-il
1975	In 1975, Kim Jong-il applied the “monolithic guidance system” to the military through three reporting lines: the General Political Bureau, the General Staff and the military secret police.
1976	After Mao Zedong’s death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping instigated unprecedented reform in China, bringing hundreds of millions out of poverty. China also built ties with Japan as part of this process
1983	Despite these developments, the DPRK sponsored a number of terrorist acts against civilian targets of the ROK. These included: the 1983 attempted assassination of the ROK President Chun Doo-hwan in Yangon through a bombing that killed 21 people including four Myanmar nationals
1980	In 1980, Kim Jong-il was appointed to the Presidium of the Politburo and the Central Military Commission. At this stage, he was officially ranked fifth within the DPRK’s leadership. Nevertheless, only Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il held positions in all three of the Party’s leadership bodies (the Politburo, Secretariat and Central Military Commission). Kim Jong-il subsequently shifted decision-making on all policies and personnel appointments from the Politburo to the Party Secretariat Office, his base of power
1986	the 1986 Gimpo Airport bombing that killed five people
1987	and the 1987 Korean Airlines bombing that killed 115 people. These actions contributed to the increasing international isolation of the DPRK
1970	Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the DPRK also accumulated substantial debt to the Soviet Union and China which it was unwilling or unable to pay.

1989	In 1989, the Sino-Soviet split came to an end.
1990	This rhetoric continued for decades. For example, food aid from the United States provided during the mass starvation in the 1990s was reportedly explained to the population as war reparations
1993	In 1993, Kim Jong-il became chairman of the National Defence Commission
1994	Kim Il-sung died in 1994 at the age of 82
1990	Although the 1990s marked an improvement in relations between the DPRK and the United States, the DPRK’s first nuclear crisis occurred in May 1994 when the DPRK unloaded fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor and withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency, ejecting its inspectors. This crisis risked derailing progress on the amelioration of relations with the United States. Through negotiations brokered by former United States President Jimmy Carter, the 1994 US-DPRK Agreed Framework provided Kim Jong-il with non-aggression assurances from President Bill Clinton as well as other concessions

1990	By the mid-1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union coincided with the end of Chinese patience with its neighbor
1992	China normalized relations with the ROK in 1992, which unsettled the DPRK. The death of Kim Il-sung in 1994 contributed to strains in the relations between the DPRK and China. In fact, one of the proximate causes of the 1990s famine was the change in trade levels with China. After the DPRK’s bilateral trade with the Soviet Union dropped more than ten-fold from $2.56 billion 1990 to $1.4 million in 1994, the DPRK became dependent on China for assistance. However, the DPRK’s bilateral trade with China fell from US$900 million in 1993 to $550 million in 1995, while food exports fell by half between 1993 and 1994.

1997	In 1997, Kim Jong-il further consolidated his grip on the state security apparatus when he transformed the Social Safety Agency into the Ministry of People’s Security and expanded the overall apparatus. On the basis of these changes, the state security apparatus expanded into a system that rested on five pillars
1998	Following a three-year mourning period, Kim Jong-il was formally elected leader by the Supreme People’s Assembly in 1998. The constitution was again revised in 1998, and Kim Il-sung was designated Eternal President. The revised constitution elevated the National Defence Commission to be the highest organ of the state, and thus its chairman, Kim Jong-il, to the highest position in the government. Lacking the war hero credentials of his father, Kim Jong-il shifted the fundamental orientation of the state in his effort to win the support of the military by bestowing on it policy influence and prestige, as well as a large share of the national budget, through the Songun, or Military First, doctrine. This doctrine has survived the death of Kim Jong-il and the ascendancy of his son Kim Jong-un as his successor
1995	The seasonal arrival of extreme rains in July and August 1995 compounded by soil erosion and river silting led to flooding that destroyed the harvest and contributed to the period of starvation that has been deemed the great famine and referred to as the “Arduous March” by the DPRK.
1996	Between 1996 and 1999, it is estimated that between 450,000 and 2 million people starved to death
1999	Between 1996 and 1999, it is estimated that between 450,000 and 2 million people starved to death
1997	In the ROK, two politically liberal presidents—Kim Dae-jung elected in 1997 and Roh Moo-hyun elected in 2002—who had strong human rights credentials, pursued policies of engagement without conditions in a bid to improve relations. Their goal was to gradually move towards reunification rather than to engender sudden regime collapse in the DPRK or violent confrontation.

Their goal was to gradually move towards reunification rather than to engender sudden regime collapse in the DPRK or violent confrontation.
1990	Normalization talks between Japan and the DPRK had begun in 1990s.
2000	President Kim Dae-jung’s “Sunshine Policy” culminated in a historic summit with Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang in 2000. President Roh Moo-hyun essentially continued the Sunshine Policy under the “Peace and Prosperity Policy”. The Sunshine Policy is estimated to have provided USD 3 billion in aid from the ROK to the DPRK. The ROK also engaged in joint projects to provide opportunities to the DPRK to earn foreign exchange and to provide channels to the international market. The Kaesong Industrial Complex was the key cooperation project
2002	In 2002, Kim Jong-il attempted to undertake economic reforms. The “7.1 Measures” (named for the date 1 July 2002 when they were announced) included the increasing of consumer prices to more accurately reflect market prices, increasing official wages, changing policies on management of state enterprises to allow more independence, and the formal establishment of general markets. While these events were unfolding domestically, Kim Jong-il was continuing to seek international assistance to compensate for the country’s economic shortfall on terms that were not easy for humanitarian agencies to accept. They culminated in a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Chairperson Kim Jong-Il of the DPRK National Defence Commission in September 2002
2002	The second nuclear crisis occurred in late 2002. During a visit to Pyongyang, United States Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly announced evidence of a secret uranium-enriching programme carried out in violation of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which he said DPRK authorities had acknowledged. The DPRK subsequently removed seals and surveillance equipment from the Yongbyon reactor, shipped 1,000 fuel rods to the reactor, expelled two International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear inspectors from the country, and announced its intention to reopen a reprocessing plant that could start producing weapons grade plutonium within months. 
2003	In 2003, United States President George W. Bush ended bilateral discussions with the DPRK. Instead, the Six Party Talks was determined to be the appropriate forum for further negotiations
2002	In the meantime, Kim Jong-il’s 2002 economic reform initiative appears to have met with backlash from the military, and ultimately he retreated. 
2005	In 2005, the DPRK attempted to revive the Public Distribution System and confiscated grain from farmers. At the same time, the government made it more difficult to cross the border into China.

2006	Nevertheless, by 2006, the ban on trading in rice and corn was effectively ended.
2006	In July 2006, the DPRK launched several long-range missiles. This led to the imposition of sanctions by various countries and a resolution by the United Nations Security Council condemning the multiple launches and calling on the DPRK to suspend all ballistic missile related activity. Months later, the DPRK announced its first nuclear test. China issued strong statements criticizing the DPRK for its actions and supported for the first time a Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on the DPRK to prevent nuclear and ballistics weapons development. Nevertheless, the criticism was quickly toned down as China has remained generally supportive of the leadership in the DPRK

2008	In 2008, Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke. 
2009	In 2009, the DPRK’s leadership attempted to gain control over its citizens and the process of marketization by implementing a drastic currency reform. Although the DPRK had previously attempted currency reforms in 1959, 1979 and 1992, the 2009 currency reform failed by causing widespread dismay and disruption by triggering massive inflation and temporarily halting the markets. The so-called reform introduced new notes with a devaluation of the currency but the salaries of state employees was effectively raised resulting in massive inflation. Many citizens had their savings disappear through the exchange limitation and the subsequent drastic rise in prices
2009	In 2009, the DPRK conducted missile tests, withdrew from the Six Party Talks, ejected all international monitors from the Yongbyon facility where it reprocessed 8,000 fuel rods and conducted its second nuclear test. The Security Council passed Resolution 1874 tightening sanctions. The DPRK accused the United States and the ROK of declaring war, leading to its announcement that the DPRK was no longer bound by the 1953 Armistice Agreement
2009	In early 2009, the official propaganda organs started mentioning the “New Star General”. 
2010	Formal evidence of the selection of Kim Jong-un as Kim Jong-il’s heir apparent only emerged in 2010. In March 2010, the ROK’s naval corvette Cheonan was attacked and sunk by an underwater torpedo, killing 46 sailors. In September 2010, during the Workers’ Party of Korea’s first convention since the 1980 Party Congress, Kim Jong-il’s sister Kim Kyong-hui and Kim Jong-un were promoted to four-star generals although neither had served in the military. At the same time, Kim Jong-un was appointed the Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission. In November 2010, the DPRK shelled Yeonpyeong Island killing four ROK citizens.

2011	Kim Jong-un is believed to have been born on 8 January 1983 or 1984. He was thus under 30 years of age at the time he succeeded to the highest political, executive and military power in the DPRK as the Supreme Leader. He has been endeavouring to consolidate his authority. In the weeks after Kim Jong-il’s death in 2011, Kim Jong-un was given the title of “Supreme Commander” of the major military organizations. Official statements from various state organs referred to him as the nation’s “sole national leader”. 
2012	In early 2012, the DPRK announced it would suspend nuclear tests and allow international inspectors to monitor the moratorium in exchange for food aid from the United States. In April 2012, however, the DPRK launched an advanced missile, the Unha-3, which failed. The United States still cancelled planned food aid.

2013	On 25 August 2013, Kim Jong-un elaborated at length on the Songun doctrine during the Day of Songun celebration. Songun was the General’s [Kim Jong-il] revolutionary idea, his practice in the revolution, his political ideal and his political mode…. Regarding the strengthening of the KPA [Korean People’s Army] as the most important of affairs in the Songun revolution, he raised the KPA as the buttress, the main force, of our revolution and achieved the historic victory in the grim anti-imperialist, anti-US showdown in defence of the country’s security and socialism by training the KPA to be the army of the leader boundlessly faithful to the cause of the WPK (Workers’ Party of Korea), to be an invincible revolutionary army. He defined the spirit of defending the leader unto death, the spirit of implementing his instructions at any cost and the self-sacrificing spirit displayed by the service personnel as a revolutionary spirit symbolic and representative of the Songun era, as the revolutionary soldier spirit, and led all the service personnel and people to live and struggle in that spirit, thus ensuring that a great turn and changes were brought about in all sectors of the revolution and construction. In order to consolidate the successes of his Songun-based leadership and administer Songun politics in a comprehensive way, he saw to it that the First Session of the Tenth Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea adopted the Socialist Constitution that embodies the idea and principles of the Songun revolution and established a new state administration structure, whose backbone is the National Defence Commission, and led all state affairs to be conducted on the principle of giving precedence to military affairs
2013	The DPRK presently has the world’s fourth largest standing army with 1.2 million active troops and 7.1 to 8.3 million in paramilitary reserves. It is believed that the DPRK’s military capability has been steadily decreasing due to obsolescence of equipment, difficulty in training, and lowering of standards for soldiers following the overall decline in nutritional status of the population and its subsequent impact on the height of prospective recruits. As the DPRK has experienced this decrease in capability, it has responded by focusing on the development of nuclear weapons and other “asymmetrical forces” such as special operations forces, chemical and biological weapons, and mini-submarines. Reportedly, the DPRK has one of the world’s largest stocks of chemical weapons. In addition to destabilizing security in the region and further isolating the DPRK, the drive to be a nuclear state has had profound consequences on resource allocation in the DPRK particularly as parts of the population were already reported to be food insecure for some time
2013	The DPRK conducted its third nuclear test in February 2013 and seeks recognition as a nuclear state from the international community. 
2013	After assuming supreme power in the DPRK, Kim Jong-un expressed his desire to revive the country's economy. On 31 March 2013, Kim Jong-un announced the “Dual Policy of Economic Construction and Nuclear Arsenal Expansion” which seemed to add improving the economy to the priority of the development of the DPRK’s nuclear arsenal. He subsequently continued to add the slogan of “improving the lives of our people” to his public statements. In November 2013, the plan to establish 14 special economic zones to attract more foreign investment was announced. 
2013	The Commission has met with credible international sources who have remarked on increased signs of prosperity in Pyongyang in the past couple of years. They cite the increased use of mobile phones in the DPRK (albeit without international access), believed to number up to 2 million subscribers, as well as the prevalence of new vehicles on the formerly quiet streets. They marvel at the opening of new restaurants which appear to be well-frequented. Some observers have been noting what could be modernizing trends in the DPRK from Kim Jong-un appearing publicly with his wife in contrast to his father and grandfather, the brief appearance of an unlicensed Mickey Mouse dancing with an unlicensed Winnie the Pooh at a state-sponsored musical performance, and the commercial launching of the country’s own home-grown tablet computer. Kim Jong-un himself has also been promoting sports in the DPRK by making public appearances at various athletic events. 
2013	At the same time, there has been a clampdown on the country’s borders since Kim Jong-un’s succession to power. The number of North Koreans who have reached the ROK fell significantly in 2012 and 2013. The Commission has received reports of the use of blackmail and coercion against those who have left the country, including threats to family members in the DPRK to entice them to return to the DPRK. Certainly, a number of Koreans who have returned to the DRPK from the ROK have appeared on state television to express their apparent remorse for leaving and voicing criticism of life in the South. Other control measures that have been reported include Kim Jong-un placing new limits on privately-funded education abroad by elite families. 
2013	The sudden execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un’s uncle, in December 2013, appears to be part of Kim Jong-un’s consolidation process. Jang Song-thaek had been considered the “control tower”, due to his role as a guide to the new leader, and was widely considered to be second-in-command within the DPRK power structure. He was the husband of the sister of Kim Jong-il and daughter of Kim Il-sung. Her condition was uncertain at the time this report was finished.
